# Framework to work with: Express.js

## Explaining the choice of framework
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. I chose it because worked with WebStorm already.

## Best Practices
1. **Code Structure**: The application has a clear structure.
2. **Package management**: Used `package.json` for dependencies.
3. **Testing**: Easy to write tests for more complex apps. I didn't use them as the app is easy to launch and refresh the page to see that the time changes in real time.
4. **Handling specific timezone**: Used the `moment-timezone` library for Moscow timezone.
